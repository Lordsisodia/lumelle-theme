      body: "Finally a cap that actually works. I've tried so many shower caps and they all let steam through. This one is completely waterproof—the satin lining keeps my hair bone dry even in my sauna-like bathroom. My silk presses have been lasting 3-4 days instead of just one."
    },

      author: "Beth",
      stars: 5,
      title: "So comfy",
      body: "No marks on my forehead and looks cute. The elastic is gentle but secure, which is huge for me. Most caps leave deep indentations on my forehead, but this one doesn't. I actually don't mind wearing it around the house before my shower."
    },

      author: "Cara",
      stars: 5,
      title: "Worth it",
      body: "Saved my blowout more than once. I gym in the mornings and used to have to restyle my hair completely after showering. Now I just pop this on and my style stays intact. It's already paid for itself in saved salon visits."

      author: "Danielle",
      stars: 5,
      title: "Blowout saver",
      body: "Stayed smooth after a long, steamy shower. I was skeptical about the waterproof claim, but it genuinely blocks all moisture. The satin interior feels luxurious against my hair. My stylist asked what I've been doing differently because my hair is so much healthier."
    },
    {
      author: "Ella",
      stars: 4.5,
      title: "Soft band",
      body: "No dents and super gentle on edges. As someone with delicate edges, finding a shower cap that doesn't cause breakage has been a struggle. The wide band on this cap is perfect. It stays in place without being too tight, which is rare to find."
    },
    {
      author: "Fiona",
      stars: 5,
      title: "Looks luxe",
      body: "Finally a cap I'm not embarrassed to wear. The quality is obvious—it doesn't look like those cheap plastic ones from the drugstore. The pink color is adorable and the satin lining makes it feel premium. I even got compliments on it at the gym!"

      title: "Curl friendly",

      author: "Hana",
      stars: 4.8,
      title: "Travel staple",

      author: "Isla",
      stars: 5,
      title: "Steam proof",

    {
      author: "Jade",
      stars: 4.9,
      title: "Satin smooth",
      body: "Interior feels like a silk pillowcase. The satin lining is what sets this apart—it's gentle on my hair and doesn't cause any friction or breakage. My hair feels just as smooth when I take it off as it did before I put it on."
    },
    {
      author: "Kara",
      stars: 5,
      title: "Stretch fit",
      body: "Roomy enough for rollers and still sealed. I sometimes set my hair in large rollers and most caps can't accommodate them. This one stretches to fit but still creates a perfect seal around the edges. The waterproof protection is impressive."

    {
      author: "Lena",
      stars: 5,
      title: "Worth the upgrade",
      body: "Feels premium compared to plastic caps. Yes, it costs more than cheap shower caps, but the quality difference is massive. The materials are better, the construction is solid, and it actually works. I've had mine for 3 months and it still looks brand new."
    },
    {
      author: "Mara",
      stars: 4.7,
      title: "Holds up",

      title: "Edge-safe",

      title: "Great gift",
      body: "Bought for my mom—she loves it. Got this as a gift for my mom who has curly hair and struggles with frizz. She's been using it every day and says it's the best shower cap she's ever owned. She's already asked me to buy her a second one as a backup!"

      { q: 'How long do the curls last?', a: 'Most customers enjoy beautiful curls all day, and many say theirs last up to 2–3 days. Smaller sections and tighter wrapping can help your curls stay defined even longer.' },
      { q: 'Is it comfortable to sleep in?', a: 'Absolutely. Our satin-wrapped rod and lightweight bonnet are designed for soft, overnight comfort, so you wake up with curls — not discomfort.' },
      { q: 'Does it help with frizz?', a: 'Yes. Satin naturally reduces friction, leaving your hair smoother, shinier, and noticeably frizz-free after styling.' },
      { q: 'Will it damage my hair?', a: 'Not at all. Our heatless system avoids the breakage and dryness caused by hot tools, keeping your hair healthier with every use.' },
      { q: 'Do I use it on wet or dry hair?', a: 'For the best results, use on dry or slightly damp hair. Damp hair creates a stronger curl, while dry hair gives softer, looser waves.' },
      { q: 'How long do I leave it in?', a: 'Leave it in overnight or for at least a few hours. The longer it sets, the more defined your curls will be.' }

    // FAQ Questions
    qa: [
      { q: 'Will it fit my hair type?', a: "Customer review 5 stars: I have very long, thick hair and this is the first towel that actually fits and stays put. It's so soft, absorbs water quickly, and doesn't feel heavy on my head like regular towels do. My hair dries so much faster and with way less frizz. Absolutely love it!" },
      { q: 'How do I wash it?', a: 'Machine wash on a gentle cycle with like colors, then tumble dry low or air dry. To keep your towel at peak absorbency, avoid fabric softeners and bleach, as these can coat the fibers and reduce their moisture-wicking ability over time.' },
      { q: 'How long does it take to dry hair?', a: 'Most customers find their hair goes from wet to damp-dry in 15 to 30 minutes, depending on hair thickness and length. The ultra-absorbent microfiber wicks away excess moisture quickly, cutting your air-dry time significantly while helping reduce frizz and breakage compared to rough cotton towels.' },
      { q: "What's the return policy?", a: '30-day Luxe Guarantee with easy exchanges or returns.' }
